# SlipKit: Earthquake Slip Inversion Package

SlipKit is a modular Python package designed for static earthquake fault slip inversion ($Gm = d$).
## Key Features:
*   **Physics Backend:** Leverages `cutde` (Triangle Dislocation Elements) for efficient elastic Green's functions computation on both CPU and GPU.
*   **Coordinate System:** Operates in local Cartesian coordinates (km) for consistent and accurate calculations.
*   **Regularization:** Implements Laplacian smoothing on unstructured fault meshes to promote geologically realistic slip distributions.
*   **Extensibility:** Designed with Abstract Base Classes for Solvers, Fault Models, and Green's Functions, allowing users to easily integrate their own custom implementations.
